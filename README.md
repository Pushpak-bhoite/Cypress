 Why cypress
 Cypress is popular because it's simple to use and comes with unique features, including:

Advanced debugging: Easily identify issues using the built-in debugging tools.
Automatic waiting: Eliminates the need for manual delays in tests.
Mocking network requests: Simulate server responses to test different scenarios.
Running tests inside the browser: Tests execute directly within the browser for a more realistic user simulation.
